# aj-weather-channel
 
# This project will retrieve weather data for cities.

# This project allows developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own.  Creates a learning tool for new developers like myself.

# This is a work in progress due to not finished but I am learning how to use an api key and some extra development tools. 

# What makes this project stand out is that you can enter any city and get the weather from it.  

# I had help from tudors and classmates and I grabbed alot of the code from class activities.
